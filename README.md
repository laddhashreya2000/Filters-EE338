# FIR and IIR Filters
Filters have a variety of applications in data acquisition and analysis. They are used to alter the frequency content of a time signal by either reducing or amplifying certain frequencies.
Two classes of digital filters are Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR). This project aims to derive the differences between FIR and IIR design in bandpass and bandstop filter types.
